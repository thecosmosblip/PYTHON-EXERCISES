PYTHON EXERCISES

1] Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.
Solution:
A = 'Sanket'
x = list(A)

for i in x[1::2]:
    print(i)


2] Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.
Solution:
A = 0

for i in range(1, 11):
    B = A + i
    print('The sum of both is ',B )
    A = i 


3] Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.
Solution:
A = int(input('Enter the First Number:'))
B = int(input('Enter the Second Number:'))

if A * B <= 1000:
    print(A*B)
else:
    print(A + B)




4] Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.
Solution:
A = 'Sanket'

n = 2
res = A[2:]
print(res)


5] Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given list is same. If numbers are different, then return False.
Solution:
A = [1,2,3,3,4,1]
for i in A:
    if A[0]==A[-1]:
        print(True)
        break
    else:
        print(False)
        break



6] Iterate the given list of numbers and print only those numbers which are divisible by 5.
Solution:
A = [30,50,24,56,78]
    
for i in A:
    if i % 5 == 0:
        print(i)






7] Write a program to find how many times substring “word” appears in the given string.
Solution:
